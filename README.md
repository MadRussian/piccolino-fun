Piccolino Fun
=============

This contains various mini projects that I've worked on with the [Piccolino](http://www.piccolino.rocks/)

All of these projects used Arduino IDE

Setup
-----

1. Go to www.piccolino.rocks and install the Arduino IDE
2. Download the libraries and put it in your arduino sketchbook/libraries directory
3. Symlink this directory so that arduino IDE sees it when you run it.
   Ex: ln -s /path/to/piccolino-fun ~/sketchbook
4. Set the Arduino IDE board to be Arduino Pro or Pro Mini (5v, 16MHz) w/ ATMega328
5. Set the Serial Port to be /dev/ttyUSB0 or something equivalent to that
